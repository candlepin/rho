* Telling if a guest is virt:

/proc/cpuinfo shows cpu type for qeum/kvm quests
dmidecode -s bios-vendor (etc) shows type for kvm/virtualbox
facter has some virt detect stuff (not great though)

/proc/cpuinfo has "hypervisor" flag set in cpu flags
(http://projects.reductivelabs.com/issues/2067)

lspci  (virtbox and kvm show up specific virt hardware devices)

lscpu? doesn't seem to be in rhel/fedora

	- /proc/scsi/*
	- /proc/ide/*   (look for QEMU disk types)


from rhn-client-tools:
          # check to see if this a PV Guest
            if os.access("/dev/xvc0", os.R_OK):
                is_pv_guest = 1

* Host detecting guests/domains
	virsh list
	virt-uname (etc)
	guestfish

	virt-cat domain /etc/sysconfig/network
	            (etc)

	/sbin/ip on host
		(look for bridges and virt bridges, and vnets)
		(look in `ip neigh` for arp stuff?)
		(can we find ip's of bridge/natted hosts?)
