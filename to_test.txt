host/ip
	- host exist, resolves, sshdis listening
	- host exists, resolves, sshd is not listening (no sshd)
	- host exists, does not resolv, sshd is listening
	- host doesn't exist, resolves, sshd is not listening (say, a virt machine thats turned off)


sshd config
	- host exists, resolves, sshd is listening, no root login
	- host exists, resolves, sshd is listening, low MaxAuthTries, multiple bad auth types
	- host exists, resolves, sshd is listening, user is in DenyUser/DenyGroups
	- host exist, resolves, sshd is listening, PasswordAuthentication is turned off, username/password used
	- ""                                     "", PrintMotd is turn on
