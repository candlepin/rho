* delete a single profile
* delete all profiles
* edit field in given profile
* prompt for ssh passphrase
* change prompt of Password: to explain what it's for
* add ability to overwrite a profile/auth
* dumpconfig should create the file?
* Password: doesn't make sense
* bin/rho auth add prints None at the end for no reason
* ports not validated for valid values i.e. -1 is accepted.
* add ssh port that worked to output report
* rho scan --range needs a decryption password (which it probably shouldn't)
* --profile is missing from rho scan
