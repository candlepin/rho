* delete a single profile
* delete all profiles
* edit field in given profile
* prompt for ssh passphrase
X change prompt of Password: to explain what it's for
* add ability to overwrite a profile/auth
* dumpconfig should create the file?
* Password: doesn't make sense
X bin/rho auth add prints None at the end for no reason
* ports not validated for valid values i.e. -1 or 333333 is accepted.
* add ssh port that worked to output report
* rho scan --range needs a decryption password (which it probably shouldn't)
* --profile is missing from rho scan
* profile add with --auth=[nonexistent auth] gives traceback, should just print 'auth doesn't exist' - same with nonexistent ssh keyfile, etc
* profile add --ip doesn't work
* rho scan --help should say "profile" on the usage line. 
* rho scan: you can scan using a profile and at the same time specify a
* --range on the command line.. the scan goes into loops
* include ip or hostname in connection failed before report is listed

* dumpconfig contains a stanza called "groups". For consistency reasons we
* think it should be called "profiles". 

* profile add --range:  the range string should be validated for format at
* profile creation

* adding a duplicate profile, causes traceback

* rho scan --ip doesnt work
 

* no dsa keys - can add using 'auth add' but then scan fails with "10.10.77.239,,,,,,,,,,connection failed using auth class: myvm not a valid RSA private key file"
* "connection failed using auth class: mypw Authentication failed." or "timed out". Need to include what IP this was.
X = fixed
