X delete a single profile
X delete all profiles
X edit field in given profile
* prompt for ssh passphrase
X change prompt of Password: to explain what it's for
* edit field in given auth
X Password: doesn't make sense (changed to Config Encryption Password:)
X bin/rho auth add prints None at the end for no reason
* ports not validated for valid values i.e. -1 or 333333 is accepted.
X add ssh port that worked to output report
* rho scan --range needs a decryption password (which it probably shouldn't)
X --profile is missing from rho scan
* profile add with --auth=[nonexistent auth] gives traceback, should just print 'auth doesn't exist' - same with nonexistent ssh keyfile, etc
* profile add --ip doesn't work
X rho scan --help should say "profile" on the usage line. 
* rho scan: you can scan using a profile and at the same time specify a
* --range on the command line.. the scan goes into loops
X include ip or hostname in connection failed before report is listed

* dumpconfig contains a stanza called "groups". For consistency reasons we
* think it should be called "profiles". 

* profile add --range:  the range string should be validated for format at
* profile creation

* adding a duplicate profile, causes traceback

* rho scan --ip doesnt work

X profile clear --name does not work 

* Can not add a private RSA key to authentication

* no dsa keys - can add using 'auth add' but then scan fails with "10.10.77.239,,,,,,,,,,connection failed using auth class: myvm not a valid RSA private key file"
X * "connection failed using auth class: mypw Authentication failed." or "timed out". Need to include what IP this was.
X = fixed

-------------------
NOT A BUG (one command uses --config the other doesn't, this
results in 2 different configs being used)

X auth configs using ssh keys not listed w/ auth show

[whayutin@thinkdoe rho]$ bin/rho auth add --name=sshKey
--file=/home/whayutin/workspace/rho/id_rsa --config=$PWD/sshConfig
--username=bad --password=bad
Config Encryption Password:
The auth name sshKey already exists
[whayutin@thinkdoe rho]$ bin/rho auth show
Config Encryption Password:
{'username': 'whayutin', 'password': 'passw0rd', 'type': 'ssh', 'name':
'default'}
{'username': 'whayutin', 'password': 'b0rder', 'type': 'ssh', 'name':
'whayutin'}
[whayutin@thinkdoe rho]$
